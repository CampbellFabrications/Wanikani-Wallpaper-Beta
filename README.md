Wanikani-Wallpaper-Beta
====================
Visit http://pyronyzen.github.io/Wanikani-Wallpaper-Beta/index.html to test this.
This Wanikani Wallpaper Generator is a modified version of Hexagenic's Wallpaper Generator.
This version offers advanced functionality and debugging of a user's Wanikani data.

This Wallpaper Generator will create a working Kanji or Radicals wallpaper.

index.html will output to the console:

	- The characters of the list that have been requested
	- The meanings of the list that have been requested


Things that do not work:

	- Creating a Vocabulary Wallpaper 
	
		I need a level 50 api key to be able to dump the vocab list characters
		The code is there to output a vocab list but the order.js file is hard-coded for the kanji and radicals
